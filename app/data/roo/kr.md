UK-South Korea trade agreement
------------------------------

The UK has signed a trade agreement with South Korea, which is in effect.

This guidance provides information on aspects of trade covered by the UK-South Korea agreement. It is for UK businesses trading with South Korea.

What the agreement includes
---------------------------

This trade agreement includes provisions on:

*   trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas, rules of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary measures
*   trade in services
*   intellectual property, including geographical indications
*   government procurement

Tariff rates on goods
---------------------

Tariff rates for bilateral trade in goods between the UK and South Korea continue to apply as set out in the agreement. However, in some cases, the non-preferential applied rates may in fact be lower because of changes in the UK’s Most Favoured Nation tariff schedule.

You can use online tools [trade with the UK](https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk) and [check how to export goods](https://www.gov.uk/check-duties-customs-exporting) to check product-specific and country-specific information on tariffs and regulations that currently apply to UK trade in goods. These tools are regularly updated to reflect any changes.

Tariff rate quotas
------------------

Tariff rate quotas in the agreement have been tailored specifically to the UK.

To find out the tariff rate quotas, see tables 4 and 5 of the [parliamentary report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/continuing-the-uks-trade-relationship-with-south-korea-parliamentary-report).

Rules of origin
---------------

### Claiming preferential rates for your exports from the UK

The requirements for claiming preference remain unchanged. Your goods should be accompanied by an origin declaration made out by one of the following:

*   an approved exporter
*   any exporter for a consignment of originating products whose total value does not exceed 6,000 Euros

Approved exporter authorisations issued in the UK prior to the UK leaving the EU remain valid in the UK for goods exported under the UK-South Korea trade agreement.

### Using EU materials and processing in your exports to South Korea

You can use EU materials or processing in your exports to South Korea. The UK and Korea must have fulfilled the necessary requirements set out in the Rules of Origin Protocol. You must also ensure the working or processing you do in the UK goes beyond the minimal operations listed in the agreement and that the other relevant conditions are met.

For example, you cannot simply package or label a product from the EU and export it to South Korea as a good originating in the UK.

See the list of minimal operations in Article 6 of the Rules of Origin Protocol in the [UK-South Korea trade agreement text](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukkorea-free-trade-agreement-with-exchange-of-notes-cs-korea-no12019).

The ability to consider materials from, or processing carried out in, another country as originating when incorporated into your product is called cumulation.

You should check with the appropriate customs authorities regarding your trade between the UK and South Korea. In particular, the Rules of Origin agreed under the UK-South Korea trade agreement are scheduled to be reviewed no later than 24 months from 1 January 2021.

### Sending your goods to South Korea through the EU and other countries

Goods transited through the EU are not subject to the same restrictions as those in transit through other countries.

For example, you can split a consignment in the EU when exporting goods to South Korea, provided the goods comprising the consignment have not cleared customs in the EU.

Transit through any other country is possible provided your goods remain under customs surveillance and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition.

### Origin quotas

Origin quotas in the agreement have been tailored specifically to the UK.

See table 6 listed in the agreement [parliamentary report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/continuing-the-uks-trade-relationship-with-south-korea-parliamentary-report) for details on the origin quotas.

Geographical indications
------------------------

Geographical indications (GIs) protect the geographical names of food, drink and agricultural products. Both the UK and South Korea’s existing GIs remain covered by this agreement.

The following UK GIs, including ‘transborder GIs’ that relate to the territory of both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, are protected in this agreement:

*   Irish whisky/Irish whiskey
*   Scotch whisky

## EU notes

In order to qualify for the lower or zero preferential tariff under the EU-Faroe Islands Free Trade Agreement the product must originate in the EU or Faroes.

The rules of origin applicable in the EU-Faroe Islands Free Trade Agreement are those included the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (PEM Convention).

The PEM Convention aims at establishing common rules of origin and [cumulation](<https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin/general-aspects-preferential-origin/arrangements-list/paneuromediterranean-cumulation-pem-convention_en>) among 25 PEM Contracting Parties ([ The list of the PEM Contracting Parties ](<https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/calculation-customs-duties/rules-origin/general-aspects-preferential-origin/arrangements-list_en>)) and the EU to facilitate trade and integrate the supply chains within the zone.

- Product specific rules are based on the Harmonised System Nomenclature 2007 Edition. 
- You do not need to apply for a preferential tariff (or comply with preferential rules of origin) if the MFN duty for your product is zero.

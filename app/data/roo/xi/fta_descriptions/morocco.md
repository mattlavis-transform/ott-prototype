Trade in industrial products is entirely liberalised, while market opening for agricultural products** **is also substantial. Both parties agreed upon a protocol establishing a [Dispute Settlement Mechanism](<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22011A0705(01)&from=SL>)[![](<https://ec.europa.eu/trade/images/bg-linktype-document.png>)](<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:22011A0705(01)&from=SL>), which entered into force in 2012.

Negotiations for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) started in 2013. A [Sustainability Impact Assessment](<https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151926.pdf>)[![](<https://ec.europa.eu/trade/images/bg-linktype-document.png>)](<https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/november/tradoc_151926.pdf>) carried out by an independent contractor accompanied the launch of negotiations. The last negotiating round was held in April 2014, after which negotiations were put on hold at Morocco’s request.

An [Amendment of the protocols of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement](<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.034.01.0004.01.ENG> "Links to an external resource")[![](<https://ec.europa.eu/trade/images/bg-linktype-external.png>)](<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.034.01.0004.01.ENG>), which extended the tariff preferences laid down in the Association Agreement to products originating in Western Sahara, entered into force on 19 July 2019. In December 2020, the European Commission published a Staff Working Document on the implementation of the agreement. The [report](<https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/2020-report-benefits-preferential_access.pdf> "Links to an external resource")[![](<https://ec.europa.eu/trade/images/bg-linktype-external.png>)](<https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/2020-report-benefits-preferential_access.pdf>) demonstrated that the agreement is being implemented smoothly and that it is delivering benefits for Western Sahara and its population in terms of exports, economic activity and employment.

In 2021, under the new [EU Trade Policy Review](<https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2021/february/tradoc_159438.pdf>)[![](<https://ec.europa.eu/trade/images/bg-linktype-document.png>)](<https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2021/february/tradoc_159438.pdf>), the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today’s challenges.

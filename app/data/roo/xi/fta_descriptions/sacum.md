## EU notes

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the Southern African Customs Union Member States (SACU) and Mozambique (SACUM), which is in effect.

The SACUM countries covered by this agreement are:

*   Botswana
*   Eswatini (formerly Swaziland)
*   Lesotho
*   Mozambique
*   Namibia
*   South Africa

EPAs are principally development-focused trade agreements that aim to promote increased trade and investment. They contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

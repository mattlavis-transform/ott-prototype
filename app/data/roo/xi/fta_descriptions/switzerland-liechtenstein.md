## EU notes

 The UK has a trade agreement with Switzerland and Liechtenstein.

Where applicable, tariff preferences are available. If the conditions for preferential access are not met, the UK’s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rate (or third country duty) applies.

This agreement largely maintains the previous EU trade agreement, including in most instances on duties. In some cases, the non-preferential applied rates may be lower because of changes in the UK’s MFN tariff schedule.

## EU notes

The UK has signed a trade agreement with Turkey, which is in effect.

This guidance provides information on aspects of trade covered by the UK-Turkey agreement. It is for UK businesses trading with Turkey.

This agreement includes provisions on:

*   trade in goods – including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas, rules of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary measures
*   customs and trade facilitation
*   intellectual property
*   government procurement
*   technical barriers to trade
*   competition
*   trade remedies
*   dispute settlement
    
When the UK was an EU Member State, its trading relationship with Turkey was governed by the EU-Turkey Customs Union, alongside an agreement on agriculture and the coal and steel agreement. This arrangement has been transitioned into a traditional free trade agreement.

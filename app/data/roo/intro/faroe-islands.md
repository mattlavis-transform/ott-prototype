The UK has signed a trade agreement with Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands (the UK-Faroe Islands trade agreement), which is in effect.

This guidance provides information on aspects of trade covered by the UK-Faroe Islands agreement. It is for UK businesses trading with the Faroe Islands.

This trade agreement includes provisions on trade in goods (including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas and rules of origin).

Tariff rates for bilateral trade in goods between the UK and the Faroe Islands continue to apply as set out in the agreement. However, in some cases, the non-preferential applied rates may, in fact, be lower because of changes in the UKâ€™s Most Favoured Nation tariff schedule.

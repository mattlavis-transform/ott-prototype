<p class="doc_text">The provisions of Article 5 of this Appendix, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Contracting Party.</p>
<p class="doc_text"><i>Example:</i></p>
<p class="doc_text">An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from ‘other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging’ of heading ex 7224.</p>
<p class="doc_text">If this forging has been forged in the European Union from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the European Union. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.</p>

<p class="doc_text">The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.</p>
</td>

<p class="doc_text">However, the expression ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading …’ or ‘Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product’ means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.</p>

<p class="doc_text"><i>Example:</i></p>
<p class="doc_text">The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.</p>

<p class="doc_text"><i>Example:</i></p>
<p class="doc_text">The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.</p>
<p class="doc_text">However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.</p>
<p class="doc_text"><i>Example:</i></p>
<p class="doc_text">In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth – even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn.

The UK has signed an Interim Trade Partnership Agreement (TPA) with Ghana which is in effect.

This is a development-focused trade agreement that aims to promote increased trade and investment. The UKâ€™s development-focused trade agreements contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

This guidance provides information on aspects of trade that are covered by the TPA. It is for UK businesses trading with Ghana.

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from Ghana. In exchange, Ghana commits to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in Ghana are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This TPA includes provisions on:

*   trade in goods (including provisions on preferential tariffs and rules of origin)

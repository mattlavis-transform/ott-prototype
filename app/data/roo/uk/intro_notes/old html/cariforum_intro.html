inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the 
EC Party or in the CARIFORUM States.</p>
<p class="doc_text">Example:</p>
<p class="doc_text">An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states 
that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may 
not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from “other alloy steel roughly 
shaped by forging” of heading No ex 7224.</p>
<p class="doc_text">If this forging has been forged in the EC Party from a 
non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of 
the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as 
originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it 
was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the EC Party. The 
value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding 
up the value of the no-noriginating materials used.</p>

processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of 
less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Therefore, if a 
rule provides that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture 
may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is 
allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.</p>

may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression “manufacture from

<p class="doc_text">Example:</p>
<p class="doc_text">The rule for fabrics of heading Nos 5208 to 5212 provides

<p class="doc_text">Example:</p>
<p class="doc_text">The rule for prepared foods of heading No 1904 which 
specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives does not prevent 
the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products 
from cereals.</p>
<p class="doc_text">However, this does not apply to products which, although 
they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the 
list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of 
manufacture.</p>
<p class="doc_text">Example:</p>
<p class="doc_text">In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made 
from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for 
this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even 
if non-woven cloth cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the 
starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the
